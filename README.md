Template A is designed to set up a basic network environment on AWS, specifically creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), public subnet, internet gateway, route table, and a security group.
Template B builds on the infrastructure set up by Template A by creating an EC2 instance with elastic IPV4 address and associating it with the previously defined VPC, security group, and subnet. It utilizes user data to configure the instance upon launch.
Integration between Templates A and Template B. Template B utilizes !ImportValue to fetch the SubnetID and SecurityGroupID from Template A. This means that Template A must be deployed first, allowing Template B to use values defined in it.Template A sets up the foundational network infrastructure, while Template B configures the compute resource (EC2 instance) that operates within that infrastructure
